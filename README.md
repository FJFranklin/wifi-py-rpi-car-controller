wifi-py-rpi-car-controller
==========================

**Overview**

This repository is really just a collection of works-in-progress
with a variety of purposes.

- ArduinoSim is a Python version of a specific introductory
Arduino lab; TinkerCad is a better solution

- NetIP has its own repository, but is an unfinished work.
There's a critical problem of buffering that needs to be
resolved.

- RTSim is a simple robot model implemented in Python and in
Matlab, as an exercise to think about navigation and steering.

- arduino/hello is a simple serial console tool for Arduinos.

- insects is a Python simulation of a bird in an insect space.

- microstick was written for a dsPIC33 Microstick.

- mqtt evolved into a separate repository - see cariot.

- noise models pathways of sound with a simple diffractive model.

- pistick is a unix tool for serial communication with devices.

- pyccar is an attempt at a touchscreen UI for Raspberry Pi.

- scene is an earlier version of noise.

- sketch is a Python CAD-sketching tool compatible with SpaceClaim.

- static is a simple CSS/SVG/Javascript UI to go with a Mosquitto
websockets broker.

- web-py-server is a car controller implemented as a Python web
server.

- wifi-py-rpi is an awful way to implement remote shutdown.
