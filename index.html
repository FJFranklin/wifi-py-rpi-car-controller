	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>In this project, the focus is on communication over WiFi, with the aim of being able to control a car
	  or other vehicle using a web interface. Ultimately I want to get this working with MQTT - essentially
	  an IoT solution - but initially this will use a web server and HTTP.</p>

	<p>A computer-controlled car - and here I'll assume the computer is a WiFi-enabled Raspberry Pi running
	  linux - needs to interact with the human (or other remote) controller, and needs to look after itself,
	  i.e., check the sensors for obstacles, update the current drive settings, adjust the steering, etc. In
	  other words, it needs to multitask. The best way to do this is via threads. It also makes sense to have
	  an event loop.</p>

	<p>Given all these requirements, I have created this project that implements the basic logic:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Written in Python and using threading and Queue for event management, and web.py for the web server.</li>
	  <li>Currently the web interface is written as a non-templated HTML document. A query/command mechanism
	    is provided for passing instructions to the car controller (via the server) and receiving data from it.</li>
	</ul>
