	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>In this project, the focus is on communication over WiFi, with the aim of being able to control a car
	  or other vehicle using a web interface. The method requires two Raspberry Pi (or other Linux) computers.</p>

	<p>One RPi, the "controller", is set up as a WiFi hub (e.g., with hostapd) and DHCP server (e.g., using dnsmasq).
	  This creates a private network which anyone may connect to - the security of the network can of course be
	  configured - over WiFi. The "controller" also runs a web server and MQTT broker with websockets support;
	  I am using mosquitto which provites a default MQTT broker as well as a web server / websockets interface.
	  The webserver serves the HTML/Javascript/CSS files that create the web interface.</p>

	<p>The other RPi, the "car", connects via WiFi to the MQTT broker, and the MQTT broker then acts as a middle man,
	  relaying data between the browser(s) and the "car". The "car", of course, is responsible for the remote device,
	  i.e., it must check the sensors for obstacles, update the current drive settings, adjust the steering, etc.</p>

	<p>Given all these requirements, I have created this project that implements the basic logic:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Written in Python and using threading and Queue for event management, and Paho.MQTT (Python).</li>
	  <li>The web interface is written as a client-side scripted interface based on HTML and SVG, and again
	    Paho.MQTT (Javascript).</li>
	</ul>
